# FasterFlats

## 1.0.0.3 - 04.02.26
- Added option to toggle Debayering. Since "Debayered HRF" and "Unlinked Stretch" settings depend on Debayering, their value is stored if disabling Debayering and restored to the last state when toggled back on. (As long as NINA is not closed their state is remembered)

## 1.0.0.2 - 14.11.25
- Fix serialization instruction to/from targets/template

## 1.0.0.1
- Initial release
